After several years of creating RIA's, Todd began sharing his knowledge with others in his community. After noticing the lack of industry knowledge being taught in the classroom, Todd began teaching at Indiana University in Indianapolis to help prepare students for real-world challenges once working in the industry.Since the crash of Flash, he has migrated to JavaScript/HTML and any other frameworks/languages out there that can get the job done, and spreads the word on how to use them. Todd also freelances and focuses on making E-Learning applications for the web and mobile devices. In his spare time, Todd enjoys playing with his son and making salsa from his garden."
